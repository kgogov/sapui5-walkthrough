# Walkthrough notes

Before we can do something with SAPUI5, we need to load and initialize it. \
This process of loading and initializing SAPUI5 is called **bootstrapping**.

SAPUI5 Controls are used to define appearance and behavior of parts of the screen. \
All controls of SAPUI5 have a fixed set of properties, aggregations, and associations for configuration. \
You can find their descriptions in the Demo Kit.
